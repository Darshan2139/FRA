          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            This project provides a centralized digital platform for managing
            Forest Rights Act (FRA) claims, mapping village-level resources, and
            supporting government schemes with AI-powered decision-making. It
            improves efficiency, transparency, and accessibility for government
            officials, NGOs, and the public.
          </p>

          <h3>Objectives</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Digitize scattered and paper-based FRA claim documents into a
              structured, searchable system.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide an FRA Atlas with interactive GIS maps showing claims,
              boundaries, and assets.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use AI and satellite imagery to map village resources (farms,
              water bodies, forests, homesteads).
            </li>
            <li>
              Enable decision support by recommending suitable schemes for FRA
              villages.
            </li>
            <li>
              Improve monitoring, reporting, and policy planning through
              analytics dashboards.
            </li>
          </ul>
